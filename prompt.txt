I want a webapp (simple 1 Html file) that's very simple, it's called "أذكار" where Muslims read prayers at day and night,
the Morning prayers "اذكار الصباح" preferred to be read during "بعد اذان الفجر" to "قبل طلوع الشمس"
the Night Prayers "اذكار المساء" preferred to be read during "بعد صلاة العصر" to "قبل غروب الشمس"

the files included for both prayers
morning.txt night.txt

the files are like this

first a title, ignore that
then the prayer itself in Arabic
then a divider with the times required that prayer to be said
then a source for that prayer
then a * as a major divider

I want the app to load on two buttons, stating "أذكار الصباح" or "أذكار المساء"
under each the time preferred to be read at

then when entering, load the prayers from the least number of saying to the highest number
if they are the same number, sort them by length (how many words)

at top card, the prayer
under it the bottom card the source
the bottom of the page a counter button, when pressed it goes up by one, it responds to how many times required for each prayer, when done, go the next prayer, I need a progress bar as a circle around that button to indicate how close you are to finish.

I want the app the have dark mode light mode options, with default to dark, and to be responsive to all screens, mainly for phone. a very modern glassy look, and fancy glows, and calm gradients like this website design https://geminicli.com/
